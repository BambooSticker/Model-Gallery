# Andy's Model Gallery

This repo contains some beautiful mathematical models I built during my coursework, research, and self-learning. 

- `axis_dispersion_model.ipynb`: [*Julia*] Axial dispersion model of a packed bed reactor solved using finite element methods.  

- `benders_mpc.ipynb`: [*Python*] A one-dimensional one-step MPC solved using Generalized Benders decomposition. 

- `QR_inventory.ipynb`: [*Python*] A visualization of the fixed-point solution of the (Q,R) inventory control model. 

- `two_stage_robust_opt.ipynb`: [*Julia*] An implementation of column-and-constraint generation algorithm for two-stage robust optimization problems with polyhedral uncertainty sets. 

- `dual_partition_2slp.ipynb`: [*Julia*] A perspective on how the recourse solution is utilized for scenario reduction for two-stage stochastic programming.
