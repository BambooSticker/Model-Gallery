# Andy's Model Gallery

This repo contains some beautiful mathematical models I built during my coursework, research, and self-learning. 

- `axis_dispersion_model.ipynb`: [*Julia*] Axial dispersion model of a packed bed reactor solved using finite element methods.  

- `benders_mpc.ipynb`: [*Python*] A one-dimensional one-step MPC solved using Generalized Benders decomposition. 

- `QR_inventory.ipynb`: [*Python*] A visualization of the fixed-point solution of the (Q,R) inventory control model.
